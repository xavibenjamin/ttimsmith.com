<p>This past week, I was so excited to be interviewed on Podcast Champion: a podcast by my pal Justin about podcasting. It was a lot of fun to talk about why I started The East Wing, what's impact it's had in my life and a lot of the behind-the-scenes work that goes into producing the show. If you're like me, curious about that type of stuff, I'm sure you'll like this podcast.</p>
