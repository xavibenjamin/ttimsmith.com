<p>Last week, I had the chance to sit down with Steve Derico and Sam Soffes. These two guys are behind one of my favorite podcasts: <a href="http://refactor.tv/">Refactor.Tv</a>. In the episode we talk about a variety of things. It was really fun to record. It feels more like you get to listen in to one of our conversations more than an actual interview.
