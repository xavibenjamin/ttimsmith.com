<p>Last week, I was asked to be on Show Me Your Mic. It's a podcast that talks to other podcasters about their setup and the story behind the shows. For me, it's a lot of fun because we talk about so much more than gear (which in my case isn't the coolest setup ever). If you're interested in podcasting or want to start a podcast of your own, I'm sure you'll like this show.</p>
